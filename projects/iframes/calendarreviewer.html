	<p>Developing and honing efficient and productive time management skills is challenging whenever individuals join a new enterprise or institution. This is particularly important for individuals moving from highly structured (e.g. High School) to less structured environments (e.g. University). In this project, we are proposing to develop a reflective application for helping new college students gain awareness and insight into their time use. The purpose of the tool is to help students organize, prioritize, and succeed in their studies within the context of competing activities of friends, work, family, etc.</p>
	<p>The application will access an individual's Google Calendar data using the Java Client Library of Google Calendar services. It will provide an annotation interface for indicating if the events planned in the calendar happened on schedule, or had been canceled or changed. Users will also be able to annotate events with meaningful tags and phrases such as 'quiet place to study' or 'possible HCI collaborators' in order to help detect patterns of useful behaviors. Overall, the application will also provide some simple statistical information as well as intuitive visualizations for the users to better understand and reflect on their scheduled events. </p>
